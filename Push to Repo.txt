How to push changes to GitHub

1. Add files you want to make changes to.

	git add <fileName>

	Do this for every file that you changed and want to push changes to

2. Commit the changes

	git commit -m <Message>

	This sets things up to be pushed. Be sure to provide a short message, explaining what changes you made (e.g. "Modified user login")

3. Push changes

	git push origin master

	It'll ask for authentication. Since it's on my account, here's the login info.

	UserName: MBogert
	Password: ensalada888lettuce
